# This is a nonstandard configuration file for the
# Translator. LCLS user may select it through the web portal of
# experiments to manage standard or monitoring HDF5 translation
# (it will work for either).
#
# Users may want to add their own psana modules to the translation. 
# The web portal of experiments allows users to specify their own release 
# directory and their own config file for automatic translation. Users are 
# encourages to make a copy of this config file, modify it, and specify it
# in the web page.
#
# The most important thing to be mindful of when modifying this config file
# for automatic translation, is to keep Translator.H5Output at the last module 
# in the psana modules parameter below:

[psana]

modules = Translator.PsanaModuleDetectorXface Translator.H5Output

[Translator.PsanaModuleDetectorXface]

# set raw_freq to n to include standard translation of detectors n shots.
# set to 1 to include all standard, but set to 0 or something negative
# to never include standard. Use something prime in case it helps with
# time bias
raw_freq = 109

# choices for detmethod are image, calib or raw. raw will be significantly faster,
# but not include any calibrations
detmethod = image

# convert calibrated detector results to int16. Results are clipped, to if gain
# caused the dectector to go outside [-32768, 32767], those values will be clipped 
# to those boundary values. Good for filesize, but lose some precision from calibration
convert_to_int16 = False

[Translator.H5Output]
# here is where you would set any Translator specific options you require.
# Several Translator.H5Output options cannot be set through the config file
# as they are controlled through the data management system. The controlled 
# parameters are:
#
deflate = 1
shuffle = True
#
# See the page https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PSDM/The+XTC-to-HDF5+Translator

# includes an expandable widget that gives one all the Translator options.
