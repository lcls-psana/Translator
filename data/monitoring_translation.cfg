# when an LCLS user uses the web portal of experiments to manage 
# online monitoring HDF5 translation for multi-calib cycle experiments,
# this is the psana config file that will be used to pick up any psana 
# configuration that the data management system does not set directly 
# for translation. Note: this is not the config file for the standard
# translation. The file automatic_translation.cfg is used for that.
#
# Users may want to add their own psana modules to the translation. 
# The web portal of experiments allows users to specify their own release 
# directory and their own config file for automatic translation. Users are 
# encourages to make a copy of this config file, modify it, and specify it
# in the web page.
#
# The most important thing to be mindful of when modifying this config file
# for monitoring translation, is to keep Translator.H5Output at the last module 
# in the psana modules parameter below:

[psana]
modules = cspad_mod.CsPadCalib Translator.H5Output

# to get calibrated cspad in the translation, keep cspad_mod.CsPadCalib at the
# beginning of the modules line. Now add any user modules *IN BETWEEN* those two.
# If user modules come after Translator.H5Output, their output will not be
# translated.

[Translator.H5Output]
# here is where you would set any Translator specific options you require.
# Several Translator.H5Output options cannot be set through the config file
# as they are controlled through the data management system. The controlled 
# parameters are:
#
# overwrite=
# output_file=   (based on experiment)
# split_cc_in_subdir=     # users can have this option set through the web page
#                         # on the data management system
#
# Below we highlight a few options useful for online monitoring

unknown_src_ok=0 
                  # set to 1 if filtering a DAQ alias that is in some 
                  # runs but not others, otherwise the translator throws an
                  # an error when it sees a src to filter that is not in the run


# deflate = -1
# shuffle = 0
# often the output of the monitoring translator is needed right away.
# turning off compression by setting deflate=-1 and shuffle=0 can
# increase performance

fast_index_force=0
               # this option should not be needed. Run the monitoring translator
               # against the small data, the .smd.xtc files. Then it will index
               # calib cycles fast from the master process. Before we had the small
               # data, there was an option fast_index that one could set to 1 to
               # index from the big xtc files more quickly. That option has been 
               # deprecated and throws an error. However, if something is not working
               # with the small data, one may still want to try fast index against the
               # big data. If so, set fast_index_force to 1. One mistake users could 
               # make is to set fast_index_force=1 and read the small data.

# if for some reason, fast_index_force is true, below are two options that control the 
# fast index search - if fast index fails, 
# increasing fi_num_blocks may still be faster than setting fast_index=0
# fi_mb_half_block=12        
# fi_num_blocks=50           


[PSXtcInput.XtcInputModule]
# Online monitoring sometimes needs to set this option, however it is controlled
# through the data management system - an option should be available to set it 
# throught the web page if need be
# liveTimeout=120
